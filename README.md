# Lightlab
A python library for remote laboratory control. Laboratory remoting greatly facilitates experimental research through access from anywhere, large dataset gathering, storage, and analysis, repeatability, live status and progress monitoring, intra- and inter-group collaboration.

Philosophy of a modern lab: https://www.readthedocs.io (not yet)

Includes:
- A shared library of instrument drivers
- Representation of state for labs of multiple users
- Driver-independent abstractions of instruments
- Utilities for data structures, advanced sweeping, search procedures, spectrum analysis, and characterization
- Constructs of laboratory virtualization for repeatability and rapid user code development
- Detailed documentation of tips, tricks, and instructions for prepping your lab for remoting

## Installation
#### From PyPI (not yet)

    pip install lightlab

#### From source
The project is on git here (not yet). Clone that project to your lab instrumentation server

    git clone <project url>

#### Supported platforms
Server: Mac OS and Linux running â‰¥python3.6; not tested on Windows (to do).

Auxiliary hosts: Mac OS, Linux, Windows

### Contributing
We welcome contributions, especially for new drivers. Fork the repo to your github user account and clone from there. Please unittest your contributions in a repeatable virtual laboratory; test the driver in experiment, not unittests; then create a pull request.

## Getting started
1. Configure GPIB/ethernet communication on an instrumentation server
2. Initialize the representation of your lab's state
3. Write a driver or use an existing one
4. Read the documentation
5. Get going!

### Documentation
Contains full instructions for getting started and setting up your lab and workflow.
