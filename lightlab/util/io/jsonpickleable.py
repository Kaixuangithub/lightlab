                They will not go into the pickled string.
                Good for references to things like hardware instruments that you should re-init when reloading.

        See the test_JSONpickleable for much more detail

        What is not pickled?
            #. attributes with names in ``notPickled``
            #. attributes starting with __
            #. VISAObjects: they are replaced with a placeholder HardwareReference
            #. bound methods (not checked, will error if you try)

        What functions can be pickled
            #. module-level, such as np.linspace
            #. lambdas

        Todo:
            This should support unbound methods
