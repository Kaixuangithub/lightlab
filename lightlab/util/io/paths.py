'''
    Resolves several directories as follows.
    These can be overridden after import if desired.

        1. projectDir
            The git repo of the file that first imported io

        2. dataHome = projectDir/data
            Where all your data is saved.

        3. fileDir = dataHome
            Where all the save/load functions will look.
            Usually this is set differently from notebook to notebook.

        4. monitorDir = projectDir/progress-monitor
            Where html for sweep progress monitoring will be written
            by ``ProgressWriter``.

        5. lightlabDevelopmentDir
            The path to a source directory of ``lightlab`` for development.
            It is found through the ".pathtolightlab" file.
            This is currently unused.
