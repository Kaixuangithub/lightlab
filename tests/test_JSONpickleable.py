''' Pretty advanced saving and loading

    Complicated linkages within members are maintained

    Attributes starting with __ are not there at all

    Some attributes are not picked, but still exist as None
        They can be specified in ``notPickled`` or if they are a subclass of VISAObject

    Remember that loading does not call __init__, so watch out for side effects.
        This is the primary reason that VISAObjects are not allowed
        because they all have side effects in the real world
